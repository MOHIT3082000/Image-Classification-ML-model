# Image-Classification-ML-model
Built an image classification ML model using TensorFlow and Keras. Prepared datasets, applied data augmentation, and designed a sequential model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Dropout layers. Trained, evaluated on test data, and visualized predictions with accuracy and loss plots.
