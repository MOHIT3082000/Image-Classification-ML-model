# Image-Classification-ML-model
Built an image classification ML model using TensorFlow and Keras. Prepared datasets, applied data augmentation, and designed a sequential model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, and Dropout layers. Trained, evaluated on test data, and visualized predictions with accuracy and loss plots.
Image Classification ML Model
This project focuses on building an image classification machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model classifies images into predefined categories through a systematic approach, from dataset preparation to prediction visualization.

Key Steps:
Libraries and Parameters:
Utilized TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and OS. Set parameters like image size, batch size, and epochs for consistent training and evaluation.

Data Preparation:

Loaded training, testing, and validation datasets.
Assigned class names and optimized the dataset for performance.
Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
Model Building:

Designed a sequential model with layers such as Input, Rescaling, Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout.
Compiled the model with appropriate loss and optimizer functions.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Trained the model on the dataset while tracking accuracy and loss.
Evaluated model performance on test data.
Visualization:

Plotted training and validation accuracy/loss curves for performance insights.
Visualized predictions on sample images to verify model accuracy.
